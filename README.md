============

Done in a few minutes with ChatGPT, plus another several hours of
polishing (lol). Run locally with `python -m http.server`. Or play
online [here](https://flags.myyc.dev).

Answers accepted: common name, official name, iso code (e.g. HR, SK).
Case and special characters (e.g. `Ã©`) ignored.

Flags are from the emoji range. ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡« may or may not be the flag of France.
Edit `countries.json` if you don't like some of the common names (or if
you don't think Guam should be there at all).
